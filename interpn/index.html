<h1 id="2023-11-24-building-a-hypercube-interpolator-in-rust">2023-11-24: Building a Hypercube Interpolator (in Rust)</h1>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The TL;DR is that we can achieve a <strong>10-150x speedup</strong> over the reference (FITPACK via scipy)
when interpolating at a small number of observation points while <strong>eliminating allocation (!)</strong>
and staying close to perf parity for larger inputs.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant to engineering optimization, where differentiation
workfloads for interpolators typically rely on forward differences that make many
function calls with a small number of inputs.</p>
<p>Similarly, in electrical, fluid, or thermal simulation, sim times are often bound to
overhead from making many calls for a small number of outputs from real-material
property data tables through an interface such as CoolProp, and this is compounded
for optimization through such simulations.</p>
<p>Finally, some perf charts for a reference case on fair ground: interpolation
at (pre-selected) random locations inside a 20x20x20 3D grid.</p>
<p>Without preallocation of outputs for the methods described here:
<img alt="no_prealloc" src="../assets/2023-11-24/no_prealloc.svg" /></p>
<p>Unlike the scipy bindings, the methods presented here
can evaluate into preallocated output storage.</p>
<p><em>With</em> preallocation of outputs for the methods described here:
<img alt="with_prealloc" src="../assets/2023-11-24/with_prealloc.svg" /></p>
<p>Hold on - did they get <em>worse</em> with preallocation? No! This is an artifact of
the benchmarking process, but one that accentuates the value of eliminating
allocation. The benchmarks are interleaved (method 1 x100, method 2 x100, method 3 x100, ...),
so they see some performance cross-talk through allocation.</p>
<p>Eliminating allocation from the <code>interpn</code> methods <em>significantly improves scipy's performance</em>
in neighboring benchmarks, despite both methods using an un-instrumented
warmup and manually calling python's garbage collector between benchmarks. The
scipy method is still allocating, it just has less overhead - so improving <code>interpn</code>'s
memory performance by evaluating into a preallocated array helps scipy even more than it
helps <code>interpn</code>. Quite an on-the-nose example of the value of avoiding allocation in application-level code!</p>
<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>First, a discussion of the state of the art, and why one might bother digging into
a field that's surely been a solved problem for some time.</p>
<h4 id="fitpack-exists">FITPACK exists</h4>
<p>As far as I'm aware, the last and only meaningful work done on general and reusable
interpolation methods for scientific computing was Dierckx's excellent 1994 textbook
and the accompanying Fortran library, FITPACK.</p>
<p>The Dierckx FITPACK library has since been absorbed into netlib alongside BLAS and LAPACK,
and remains under a homebrewed license.</p>
<p>As such, it is usually integrated into other ecosystems as a user-side dependency,
often in addition to all of the dependencies required to compile Fortran and produce
bindings in the target language.</p>
<p>Notably, the scipy project includes bindings to many FITPACK routines.
In Rust, the <a href="https://docs.rs/splinify/latest/splinify/">splinify</a> library provides
bindings to select splining routines, although I have not been able to get through
the game of dynamic dependency whackamole to get it to build successfully.</p>
<p>FITPACK supports many pieces of functionality that are out of scope here - 
in particular, Dierckx gives a thorough and performant treatment to <em>fitting</em>
the interpolator coefficients, smoothing, and surface identification,
often by finding fairly inspired phrasings of fitting problems as quadratic
programs regardless of the polynomial order of the curvefits.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-not-fitpack">This is not FITPACK</h4>
<p>The goal of this project is not to replicate all of FITPACK's functionality.
In fact, curve fitting in its entirety is out of scope.
Instead, this project will focus on the interpolation tasks common in scientific
computing, which (possibly after some uncertainty-weighted fitting) typically hold
a hard requirement on the interpolator reproducing the anchor values exactly.</p>
<p>Unlike fitting and interpolation for graphics, the correctness of the result is
the highest priority, followed by performance and ergonomics in close succession.
Smoothing or other manipulation of the data are anti-goals, as they directly
compromise correctness.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-something-more-specific">This is something more specific</h4>
<p>Good quality scientific methods for curvefitting are a larger topic than
interpolation, and while there are surely patterns in the process,
those methods also tend to be fairly bespoke to the problem under examination.</p>
<p>Functionality goals
* Evaluation of values (and later, gradient and hessian entries) for exact interpolators
in Rust
* Self-contained (evaluate using only grid locations and data values)
  * Avoid the need for another program or library to provide spline knots, etc
* Clear and permissive licensing
* Convenient, structured, and version-controlled build process
* Convenient inter-languge interop &amp; first-class support for bindings
* Compatibility with embedded and high-performance systems (no allocation)
* Smooth transition from interpolation to extrapolation (to support solvers)
* Separation of bounds error checking from interpolation/extrapolation (to support solvers)</p>

<h3 id="implementation-selecting-a-method">Implementation: selecting a method</h3>
<p>First, there are three approaches to interpolation on a regular
or rectilinear grid that I've come across, and I had to choose one.
* Recursive (like FITPACK)
* Convolution (as used in GPU libraries)
* Geometric (no implementations I'm aware of)</p>
<h4 id="recursive-method">Recursive method?</h4>
<p>The recursive method is fairly intuitive in addition to being
fairly performant, and making no compromise on correctness or generality.
The idea is to interpolate on one axis at a time, projecting the grid cell into
lower dimensions until finally arriving at a point.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/3d_recursive.jpeg" alt="3d recursive method" width="200"/></p>
<p>It's easy enough to imagine how this recursive method would generalize to
extrapolation or to higher dimensions - do nothing, and it will handle
those cases just fine.</p>
<p>However, the amount of data that needs to be actualized at each step of the recursion
varies with the number of dimensions - <code>O(2^(ndims - 1))</code> per observation point,
plus or minus a factor of 2 depending on how hard one would like to optimize it.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is a lot depends on circumstance - but it'd sure be neat if
we could find a way to use a constant amount of storage, or at least an amount
that scales more favorably with the number of dimensions.</p>
<h4 id="convolutional-method">Convolutional method?</h4>
<p>The convolutional method doesn't make much of a diagram, but it's exceptionally fast
on GPU for image scaling, and generalizes to higher polynomials.
Unfortunately, it doesn't handle points near the edge of the grid very well, nor
extrapolation - in fact, its performance gains are directly the product of
sacrificing both correctness and generality.</p>
<p>You also have to develop the
footprint coefficients specifically for every dimensionality, and while
I'm sure there's some series formulation of it similar to how finite difference
coefficients are tabulated, I have no desire to develop that formulation.</p>
<p>It's excellent for resampling images, and there's a huge market for that,
but it's not quite what's needed for scientific computing.</p>
<h4 id="geometric-method">Geometric method</h4>
<p>The geometric method, as far as I can tell, only exists as a blurb on wikipedia
intended to give an intuitive explanation of the behavior of the better methods.</p>
<p>The idea is that each grid cell can be partitioned into sub-cells characterized
by the vector from the observation point to each grid cell vertex. This partitioning
fully fills the grid cell. A multilinear interpolation can be obtained as the sum
of the values at each grid cell multiplied by the area of the opposing sub-cell.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/2d_inner.jpg" alt="2d geometric method on interior of grid cell" width="200"/></p>
<p>It's intended as an educational aid, but as an algorithm, it has some interesting
properties that merit a harder look.</p>
<p>First, the <strong>memory scaling is excellent</strong>: only <code>O(ndims)</code> stack usage is ever
needed simultaneously per observation point.</p>
<p>Second, it is better-positioned to <strong>avoid floating point error</strong> due to aggregating the
contribution from each of the grid cell vertices simultaneously (a sum of products)
rather than the recursive method's long chain of alternating subtractions, divisions,
and multiplications. In fact, division is eliminated entirely, and the longest chain
of error-prone add or sub operations is of a constant length 2 instead of length <code>ndims</code>.
The longest chain of multiplications is <code>ndims</code>, but only one division is required per
observation point regardless of dimensionality, and multiplications are a relatively
minor contributor to float error compared to addition and subtraction.</p>
<p>Third, it may actually be more correct, in a sense, than the recursive method,
because under extrapolation, it will not extrapolate the derivatives on each axis
the way that the recursive method does - instead, it produces a purely linear result
for observation points on both the interior and exterior of the grid.</p>
<h3 id="extending-the-geometric-method-to-extrapolation">Extending the geometric method to extrapolation</h3>
<p>The geometric method sounds good on paper, but let's see how it holds up
in a practical implementation. In particular, we need it to work well 
(1) in extrapolation and (2) in higher dimensions.</p>
<p>I filled up a notebook with doodles and algebra figuring this out, but I'll spare
us both the excessive summations and keep the abuses of notation between me
and the graph paper. Visual depictions of computational geometry fare better than obfuscatory equation soup, anyway.</p>
<h4 id="extrapolation-without-adjustment">Extrapolation without adjustment</h4>
<p>Let's try extrapolating in 2D.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/2d_extrap.jpg" alt="2d geometric method extrapolated in corner region" width="200"/></p>
<p>Well, that didn't work - at least not without some extra handling.</p>
<h4 id="extrapolation-by-extending-the-grid">Extrapolation by extending the grid?</h4>
<p>One option would be to extend the grid cell to include the full area including the
observation point. </p>
<p>On inspection, this is the same as the recursive method - we
would need to treat each dimension in extrapolation one at a time, actualize the
new grid, then finish the interpolation (which, in this case, would just be taking
one corner of the grid as the final value).</p>
<p>That's not great. For one thing, it would have a worse memory scaling, and I'd be
implementing both methods instead of just one. For another, it produces a dubious result
when the grid data describes a nonlinear function: the extrapolation would twist
the grid cell like a potato chip, effectively extrapolating the derivatives as
well as the value and producing a kind of <em>quadratic</em> extrapolation instead of
a linear one.</p>
<p>There's a better way, but it involves chewing a bit of glass.</p>
<h4 id="extrapolation-by-a-pile-of-extra-logic">Extrapolation by a pile of extra logic</h4>
<p>I don't have a good name for this process. It's a turducken of constructive
geometry and plain algebra - basically reverse-engineering
the failure of the method to naturally extend to extrapolation, and eliminating
those failures.</p>
<p>We clearly need to zero-out the contribution from vertex <code>A</code> as we move into
extrapolation to produce the same result we would get by taking the finite difference
from <code>B</code> to <code>C</code> and from <code>D</code> to <code>C</code>, and extrapolating linearly on each axis - 
the hand-written extrapolation wouldn't include a contribution from from <code>A</code> at all.</p>
<p>We also need to negate the contribution from the grid points on the interior of the
grid - the areas that split the grid cell evenly before are now overlapping, and
the result we need is no longer any weighted average of the grid values. But,
imagining that we were in 3D, we could be still need to do <em>some</em> grid-cell-based
weighted-averaging, because we could be extrapolating on two axes (as in the 2D example)
while interpolating on a third axis.</p>
<p>Once we've zeroed-out the contribution from the inner point <code>A</code> and negated
the contributions from points <code>B</code> and <code>D</code>, we have another problem.</p>
<p>All three non-zeroed points <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code> share an overlapping region
which has an area that scales not linearly but quadratically with the position
of the observation point. This can't be part of the final interpolated result,
but it's easy enough to find the area of the nonlinear region and remove it.
This removal process is, conveniently, still an O(1) process for each
vertex of the grid cell, so while it makes extrapolation slightly slower,
it doesn't change the overall perf scaling.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/2d_extrap_corrected.jpg" alt="2d geometric method extrapolated in corner region, with corrections" width="200"/></p>
<h3 id="extending-the-geometric-method-to-higher-dimensions">Extending the geometric method to higher dimensions</h3>
<p>Well, that's settled, right? It's not, but you get to find out the way I found out -
after slogging through a 3D implementation.</p>
<p>Let's see how it looks in 3D, interpolating to points on the interior of the grid.</p>
<p>To start, we'll look at a point that's on one face of the grid cell, so that
we can see what's going on without a forest of lines getting in the way,
and leaving two of the sub-cells un-shaded to unclutter the diagram.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/3d_inner.jpg" alt="3d geometric method, a simple case on the interior" width="200"/></p>
<p>So far, so good. With a bit of staring and thinking, it's clear that this produces the
same behavior as the 2D version as the observation point moves around the face of the
cube.</p>
<p>As it moves to the interior of the cube, things get a little more detailed.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/3d_inner_2.jpg" alt="3d geometric method, a simple case on the interior" width="200"/></p>
<p>Here I'm only shading two sub-cells again to keep the clutter down, but it's clear to see
that the partitioning still fills the space, and the volume of each sub-cell scales
linearly with the observation point's position on each axis.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's all working well so far! Let's see how the fixes from the 2D method hold up
under extrapolation in a side region.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/3d_extrap_side.jpg" alt="3d geometric method, extrapolating in a side region" width="200"/></p>
<p>Looks good! Only two of the regions are shaded again, but from this, we can
already tell that negating the contribution from the points on the interior
of the grid will have the intended effect, same as in 2D.</p>
<p>Next, a look at the corner region, where we can exercise the fixes that zero-out
the contribution from the entirely-inside vertex and trim the nonlinear region.</p>
<h4 id="a-problem-in-higher-dimensions">A problem in higher dimensions</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/2023-11-24/3d_extrap_corner.jpg" alt="3d geometric method, extrapolating in a corner region" width="200"/></p>
<p>Uh-oh. Only shading the nonlinear region(s) this time, because that's the catch:
there isn't just one kind of nonlinear region, and the fix based on the 2D method
only capture the cubic region, not the quadratic regions.</p>
<h4 id="a-solution-in-higher-dimensions">A solution in higher dimensions</h4>
<p>It turns out, we can handle this, too - but not by enumerating all of the kinds of
nonlinear region in higher dimensions. Or at least, I don't know how to do that.
Instead, we can observe that all of the <em>linear</em> regions are of the same form,
the rectangular prisms projecting from each face of the cube. We can also make
a real claim that this will be the case in all higher dimensions, because any region
that grows in a direction not aligned with the coordinate axes will have a nonlinear
volume scaling, so all the linear regions must be aligned with the coordinate axes.</p>
<p>So, rather than removing all the bad regions, which only works well in 2D, we
can cycle through all the axes and take all the good regions that are
projected from the n-cube's faces. This works, including in higher dimensions,
and produces a true linear extrapolation outside the grid. However, it does
cost in performance: for the corner regions where this culling process is
required, the cost of evaluating an observation point scales like <code>O(2^ndim + ndim^2)</code>
instead of just <code>O(2^ndim)</code>.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, this is not too bad, but it is noticeable - about a factor of
2-4 reduction in throughput when extrapolating in corner regions, which
also breaks timing guarantees (not ideal for, say, embedded control systems).</p>
<p>With that, we have a method that generalizes to arbitrary dimensions, or at least to
the 10 dimensions I've tested it in, under both interpolation and extrapolation in every
type of region. And it can do this with no allocation (except, possibly, for somewhere
to put the output) and with stack usage that scales linearly in the number of dimensions.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>I am happy to report that due to the efforts of the cargo-semver-checks, release-plz, maturin, and PyO3
developers, I can gloss over the relatively painless process of releasing the rust library on crates.io,
generating python bindings, and releasing the python bindings on PyPI.</p>
<p>Instead of agonizing over tooling and processes, I can focus on extending the existing functionality.
Next on the list, in any particular order that I find inspiration, are:
* Proper multi-cubic (Hermite spline) interpolation
* Vectorized alternatives to the multilinear methods here (for the high-throughput and timing-sensitive regimes)
* Triangular and tetrahedral mesh interpolation
* Perf optimizations of the python bindings for the existing multilinear interpolators</p>
